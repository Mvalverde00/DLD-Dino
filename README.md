# DLD-Dino
This is a project which myself, along with three others created at Cooper Union's *Digital Logic and Design* course, over the Summer of 2017.  It is a hardware version of Google Chrome's popular Dinosaur Game, which automatically loads in the browser upon losing Internet connection.  It was created using only basic circuitry components, such as multiplexers, logic gates, shift registers, and 555 timers.  In this repository, I have uploaded various documentation from the project.  Note that this is incomplete, as in our race to meet the deadline and finish in time, we had to forsake properly documenting every module of the project.

See the Video.mp4 file to see the game in action.  Note that one of the green dinosaur LEDs unforunately burned out, but we couldn't easily replace it due to all the messy wire soldering in the back.

The game-display and full-game-display files show close-up and full-view shots of the game box, respectively.

The behind-the-scenes file shows the breadboards and circuitry which run the game.  Be warned, it is very messy.

The Jumping-plan file contains XML data, which can be opened up in LogiSim to view and interact with the circuit plan.
