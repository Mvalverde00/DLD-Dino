# DLD-Dino
This is a project which myself, along with three others created at Cooper Union's *Digital Logic and Design* course, over the Summer of 2017.  It is a hardware version of Google Chrome's popular Dinosaur Game, which automatically loads in the browser upon losing Internet connection.  In this repository, I have uploaded various documentation from the project.  Note that this is incomplete, as in our race to meet the deadline and finish in time, we had to forsake properly documenting every module of the project.
